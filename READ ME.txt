    5 topics that I find interesting relating to computers:
        -Computer components. The way RAM, processors, motherboards, and other parts all work.
        -Electricity, understanding when it will pass through wire and when they won't utilizing the energy. All very cool
        -Video game design, I grew up on video games and love to explore and understand all the inner game concepts. 
        I don't plan on going into the gaming industry but I'd love to dabble some in game design for myself
        -The internet, routers and modems. Understanding how we have access to all this information, where is it stored. Exciting stuff
        -Coding. I have touched a few different languages overtime and enjoy how it works. I really enjoy developing programs that preform the way I want, 
        and to some degree I must be a masochist because debugging can be fun if it doesn't take hours.
    5 topics that I find challenging relating to computers:
        -I find it challenging to know which career field I will want to go into that is in relation to computers. 
        Do I want to sit behind a desk and code for hours on end, and for what purpose? 
        Or do I want to be more hands on with hardware.
        -Sometimes I find it difficult to remember all the cool coding tool I have access to and when they work best with one another to have the most efficient program. 
        For example, knowing I can make arrays and lists, but which would be best for this hypothetical program.
        -I find it difficult to outline programs that are not simple. 
        I am usually throwing myself in head first to figure out some of the more difficult bits first, and then trying to make it all work. 
        -Typing, I feel weird to not be amazing at typing for I have spent a lot of time at a keyboard, but to type fast and accurate is challenging for me. 
        -I find building computers difficult. While it is fun too, matching all the hardware to make sure it is compatible, 
        finding decent prices without sacrificing too much performance, and keeping hardware safe, as in not damaging it with static electricity or hurting fragile parts.
